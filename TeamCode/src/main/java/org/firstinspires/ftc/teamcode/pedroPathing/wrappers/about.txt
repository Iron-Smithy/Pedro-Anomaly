Each auto is a singular file which can be mirrored by changing the alliance variable before initialization.

to allow for the selection of both auton alliances, wrappers files were made to represent both possible states.

The naming convention for files and folders:
    AutonB represents a base auto file

    Auton_[Blue/Red]Wrapper_... = the wrapper for that alliance auton

    Far or Close determines the starting location of the Auton

    after the starting location the order of the ball collection and scoring is listed:
      * P = Shoots Preload
      * 1, 2, 3 = index numbers we have assigned the rows/spikes
      * H = Human player ball collection
      * G = gate

    the order of those symbols in the name determines which and what order actions that file performs.

    Then a final number to determine file version when necessary
